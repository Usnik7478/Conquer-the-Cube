#Conquer the Cube: An AR-powered Rubik's Cube Solver
This project tackles the iconic challenge of solving a scrambled Rubik's Cube using the magic of computer vision and augmented reality. Here's how it works:

1. Live Webcam Feed
   ```
   The program taps into your webcam, displaying a live video stream in all its scrambled glory.
   ```
2. AI-powered Scanning
  ```
  Using the powerful OpenCV library, the program intelligently scans each face of the cube, meticulously recognizing the color arrangement.
  ```

3. Real-time Textual Guidance
   ```
   Forget cryptic notations! Clear textual instructions accompany the live video, guiding you through each step of the solving process.
   ```

5. AR Arrows Take Over
   ```
   Once scanning is complete, the program unleashes its augmented reality magic. Arrows directly overlay the live video, dynamically pointing towards the exact moves you need to make on the cube itself.
   ```

6. 25 Moves to Victory
   ```
   Follow the intuitive AR-powered guidance, and in just 25 precise moves, you'll witness the transformation: a once-scrambled cube, now perfectly solved!
   ```
